Variables: 
	Any program that is useful at all is going to make use of data, 
be it strings, numbers, or whatever. Most of the time, having data means 
that you need the ability to store that data and pass it around. One way 
to do that would be to know the location in memory where data is stored, 
but that seems very cumbersome and difficult. An easier way would be to 
have a container for data that you could reference quickly and easily. 
This is what variables are. Variables are containers for data to which 
you can assign a name. When one wants to make use of the data stored in 
the variable, it can then be referenced by invoking the name of the 
variable. 

	Variables have some important properties that one needs to be 
aware of when making use of them. The first is the concept of scope. 
Scope, to put it simply, refers to the idea that your variables are not 
accessible, available, or visible to every part of your program. 
Variables that are declared or created inside of a function are only 
accessible or visible from within that function (i.e. their scope is the 
inside of the function in which they are declared). 
	
	Similar to scope  is the idea of lifetime, or how long the 
variable exists within the program. In most languages, the lifetime of a 
variable begins when the function begins executing and ends when the 
function terminates. 

Strings:

	Strings are literals or variables that contain text data. 
Although text data often includes numbers, it's important to note that a 
string numeral is not the same as a numerical literal or variable such 
as an int. Mathematical operations are not defined between strings and 
numbers, so '25' - 13 is not a valid operation.
